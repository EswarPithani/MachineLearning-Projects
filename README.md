During my summer vacation, I worked on several exciting machine learning projects. These included a spam email predictor and a movie recommendation system, among others.

The spam email predictor uses natural language processing techniques to analyze email content and identify characteristics of spam. By training the model on a dataset of labeled emails, I was able to achieve a high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and legitimate messages.

In addition, I developed a movie recommendation system that utilizes collaborative filtering and content-based filtering methods. This system analyzes user preferences and movie features to suggest films that users are likely to enjoy based on their previous ratings.

These projects not only enhanced my programming and analytical skills but also deepened my understanding of machine learning concepts.
